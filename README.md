# Obstacle Ball Run
 
This is my second independent project.

This is a hyper casual type game. The game's rules are straightforward: control the ball as it moves toward the goal while dodging obstacles in your path. The rating is based on your time to complete, you finish faster more star you get.

The project's gameplay and user interface are finished. Easy to create a new Level, duplicate the Level scene, scriptable object "Level Information" & The button in select menu. To construct a new level, you don't need to modify the code.

You simply need to ensure that the Scene name, Button name (Level Select), and Level Info name (Scriptable Object) are "Level x" because this project heavily relies on stringÂ (x is the number of the level).
